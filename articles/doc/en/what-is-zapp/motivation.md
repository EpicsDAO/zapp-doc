Despite the fact that many people in the software development field are struggling with blood and sweat every day, the software becomes a legacy (code that is extremely difficult to fix, extend, or work for whatever reason). The number of difficult problems that make people hold their heads is increasing, and such difficult problems continue to erode people's hearts.

Software development projects, which are inherently prone to failure, are currently causing huge losses around the world each year.

## Purpose of the ZAPP project

The ZAPP project was launched with the goal of reducing software development, operation and maintenance costs.

In today's world of in-house software development, ZAPP will continue to develop as open source in order to support DX (digital transformation) realization scenarios in all industries, and will contribute to solving problems in software development in general. I think.

## The painstaking task of server management

Historically, server management has always been a daunting task for us, and we have experienced many sleepless nights.

Although each server setting is very important, efficient visualization is difficult and it is very difficult to grasp the whole.

While we often suffer from differences between development and production environments, even a single typo can bring down the server and take time to identify errors.

Also, in many cases, server resources are prepared in advance, so it is necessary to predict the peak access load for each service. And if that prediction is wrong, the server will go down or there will be a significant response delay.

With so many issues around server management, the time spent on them can be quite significant.

## Cloud and serverless era

Today, cloud technology has evolved, and the idea of serverless has been born and put into practical use.

The serverless architecture allows you to build highly scalable and scalable apps while minimizing server management costs by using a managed environment in the public cloud.

## About ZAPP architecture

ZAPP is a cloud-era Rust serverless framework that delivers high change durability, flexible scaling, and fault tolerance while maintaining development speed to meet business demands.

We focused on speeding up development and reducing server management concerns while retaining the powerful safety and fast processing of Rust. This is to respond to businesses that are changing at an ever-increasing rate.

Rust is a programming language officially released in 2015. Rust is a language that places great importance on program execution speed. There is a website called "Benchmark Games" published by the "Debian" project, one of the Linux distributions, that compares and verifies the speeds of various programming languages. According to the speed comparison table between programming languages published there, Rust is as fast as C and C ++, which are said to be the fastest.

We take advantage of the ever-evolving Rust development peripheral tools, such as the Rust Analyzer, which was introduced as standard with the Rust 2021 edition update, to ensure improved development experience, speed, and code quality. All of this code, including GraphQL Rounting and migration files, is automatically generated by Scaffold from the data model Entity, helping to maintain a fast-developing and easy-to-maintain code base.

With the realization of a serverless architecture, the times when it is difficult to manage the server settings and status that are difficult to visualize, such as the difference between the development environment and the production environment and the complicated cron, are ending. Whether you're scaling your server as your service scales or withstanding spikes of traffic on sale, infrastructure challenges that are common to web applications are almost always solved automatically.

Codebase version control with GitHub and automated testing & deployment with GitHub Actions are also included by default. Allows teams to work efficiently and release changes quickly, preventing error codes from entering production.
